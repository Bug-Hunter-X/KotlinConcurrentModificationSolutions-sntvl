This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin involving ConcurrentModificationException.  The `bug.kt` file shows how attempting to remove elements from a mutable list while iterating with a standard for loop leads to this exception.  The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a corrected approach using iterators or alternative iteration methods.  This is a good example for understanding the importance of safe collection modification in Kotlin.
